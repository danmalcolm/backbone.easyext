CHILDVIEWS
----------

Don't directly render child views, they might need to wait for data to load etc

What happens when attaching for second time? 

Copy parent view options: parentOptions: "*", parentOptions: "model level"

Special case treatment of model or collection option properties, look up attribute from parent view's model, e.g.
options: { model: "Owner" ... } or options: { collection: "Employees" ... }

Rename property used for multiple from collection, e.g. 
multiple: { options: [ { m: "1" }, { m: "2" } ] }, 
multiple: { collection: "mike" }

Attach modes, e.g. attach, append
